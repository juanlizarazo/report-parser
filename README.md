# report-parser

This program takes a person's credit report, parses it, and outputs JSON describing
both the parsed contents of the credit report and some derived facts.

Built using node 10.

Build with JS without external packages (except for testing).

It parses a local report located in src/app/report.txt

At this time, to stay within scope, dynamic file paths through the console are not supported.

Feel free to replace `src/app/report.txt` with any other report you want to test or parse.

# Approach

- Code is self documenting, it is composed by a `main.js` file that runs the process report method.
- There's a helper class to help parse the report line items and format them correctly.
- The constants folder has the codes and the display names.
- The `ReportOutput` model calculates totals based on the trade lines as they are added. I did this in case we have very large files, I don't have to iterate again over all the line items.
- I also used a stream reader to read the file lines, to not load everything in memory at once but process by chunks.
- Some classes use private constants that are just of the concern of the class itself and I decided to encapsulate them.
- Unit tested with Jasmine. Inputs -> Outputs to not test implementation details.

# To parse report

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install DEV dependencies. These are only needed to run unit tests.

- Just run `yarn start` or `npm start` in your terminal to parse and see report output.

# To run tests

- `yarn test` or `npm test` to run 16 specs, written about the given criteria.
